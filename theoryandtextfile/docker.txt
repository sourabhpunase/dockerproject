after installation docker now comes why we need docker
we need docker because virtual machine can take lot of space while we can simply use docker images instead of full os which is space efficient and version controlled 
we can use ubuntu and can initialise other using commands
to run = docker run -it node 
here run is used to run it means we want interaction and node is the program we want to run

to exist we can just type "exit"
after running this commands if program is not present than the docker will pull out the program and if its already present than it will run it

we have dockerhub similar to github where we can find all programs like node ubuntu
 here we can use containers and after running node containers are running inisde our main program



 question 
 how to create our own image such that anyone can use it
